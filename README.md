# March Madness Model
NCAA Division I Men's Basketball tournament is a planned single-elimination tournament of 68 teams to determine the men's National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I college basketball national champion for every year.
[Google Cloud & NCAAÂ® ML Competition 2020-NCAAM](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-mens-tournament/overview) is a competition put forward by Google Cloud and NCAA organisations to apply machine learning to NCAA March Madness.
Regardless of the tournament being cancelled I am putting forward an application of various classification algorithms over the collected data to get the accuracy of the model.

### Things Done
Applied Logistic Regression, Light GBM, XGBoost and Random Forest. 
* In case of Logistic Regression, pushed in all the features and from there got an inference about the weights that each feature puts on the model.
* In case of Light GBM, XGBoost and Random Forest, the parameters have been tuned from some resources already present on the competition page and then again fine tuned according to the personal data.

### Future Improvements to this repository
* An extensive EDA can be done on my own, rather than just reading from other kernels.
* Preferably better Feature Selection techniques can be applied than just seeing the weights of the features.
